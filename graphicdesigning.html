    <h1 id="chuki">Data Analysis</h1>
    <p id="pne">Graphic design for web development is a crucial aspect of creating an engaging and user-friendly online
        experience. It involves the strategic use of typography, color schemes, images, and layout to enhance the visual
        appeal and functionality of a website. Effective graphic design not only captures the user's attention but also
        guides them through the site, ensuring a seamless and intuitive navigation experience. By blending aesthetic
        principles with usability considerations, graphic designers can create web interfaces that are not only visually
        stunning but also highly functional, ultimately contributing to the overall success of a website.
